  <h1>My Expertise</h1>
  <p>I created this entire website from scratch using GitHub, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="blank">Jekyll</a>,
    <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org" target="blank">Markdown</a>, HTML, and SCSS, along with various other
    languages and techniques.</ <p>I am a cybersecurity and privacy risk consultant from Minneapolis, MN. Currently, I
    work on <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org" target="blank">Payment Card Industry (PCI)</a> risk
    assessments, reports on compliance (ROC), and Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) testing. As of February 2022, I have
    begun studying for the assessment to receive my <a href="https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cisa"
      target="blank">Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) Certification</a>.</p>
  <p>I also recently accepted a part-time position as a tech fellow for <a href="https://codepath.org"
      target="blank">CodePath.org</a>. I will be assisting with their Cybersecurity and Hacking course, which was
    developed with Facebook to provide college students with hands-on experience in offensive security. The class
    focuses on web applications security, challenging students to learn to think like a hacker and exploit
    vulnerabilities, while also exploring how to build offensive capabilities into applications.</p>
  <p>On May 15, 2021, I graduated summa cum laude from St. Ambrose University in Davenport, IA with a Bachelor of Arts
    degree in Cybersecurity, a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, and a minor in Criminal Justice. </p>
